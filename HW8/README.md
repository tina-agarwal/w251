### Part 1: Image Annotation:  

1. In the time allowed, how many images did you annotate?  
365  

2. Home many instances of the Millennium Falcon did you annotate? How many TIE Fighters?  
'TIE Fighters': 275, 'Millennium Falcon': 275  

3. Based on this experience, how would you handle the annotation of large image data set?  
It's tedious to annotate data manually and is error prone.   

4. Think about image augmentation? How would augmentations such as flip, rotation, scale, cropping, and translation effect the annotations?  
Box bouding the image changes as a result pixel values changes  

### Part 2: Image Augmentation  
1. Describe the following augmentations in your own words  
Flip - Flips the image either Horizontally or vetically.   
Horizontal flip- Mirrors the image around a vertical line through its center  
Vertical Flip - Mirrors the image around a horizontal line running through its center  
Rotation - Rotates the image based on the angle of rotation  
Scale- Makes images smaller or larger  
Crop - cuts part of the image  
Translation- Translating image to a size specified in x and Y directions  
Noise- Adding noise to an image based on floating point noise value  

### Part 3: Audio Annotation  
1. Image annotations require the coordinates of the objects and their classes; in your option, what is needed for an audio annotation?  
Dimensions of waveform
